# Hello, World! Should I call it like `First Post`?

**My Journey into the land of Data Science and back.** The name 'aliknds' stands for `Alik Nikanorov Data Science`. 


Here, I will share with the work I have been doing in the field of data science. But before, I will work on some basic structure of my .index file. And then, I will start a new post with the words... `Here is the story how I turned .jpg file to DataFrame by using someone work from HuggingFace.`

# Here is the current projects 

- Internal supply-chain management system written in pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript 
    - Pure JavaScript to keep logs of deliveries online, should be saved in SQL format? 
- Internal table recognition script that uses pytesseract and other libraries to read tables in .png and .jpg files 
- Publicly available blog about my persobal data science journey, there will be few jupyter notebooks analyzing  tourism data and other related information 
- Drag-and-drap UI program written in Python to format .xlsx files into ready-to-visualize .csv files (this is also internal project)
